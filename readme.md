# Javascript canvas shooter game
The idea was to build a simple mouse driven shooter game using html5 canvas and Javascript. While taking the first steps I realized I needed a way to comfortably draw levels without figuring out the exact coordinates all the time and so I made a very simple level editor to start things off. Collision detection on a canvas seems to be a problem because I don't want to cycle through all the objects every frame. I'll figure it out someday, I hope.
